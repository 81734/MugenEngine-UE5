# MugenEngine-UE5
The Sonic Infinity Engine by Oban, ported to Unreal Engine 5. Requires UE5.0EA or higher.

While everything is mostly unchanged from the original UE4.21 build of Infinity Engine, the lighting in the test stage is now at sunset. In addition, Lumen has been enabled.

Do note that Sonic's boost is broken in this. It was like that in the OG build from what I remember. If you want to fix it, go ahead, since I doubt I'll learn how to do blueprints in the future.
