# MugenEngine-UE5
The Sonic Infinity Engine by Oban, ported to Unreal Engine 5. Requires UE5.0EA or higher. Mainly to take advantage of Lumen.

As of January 15, 2022, the build has been updated to the Max & Adam Final Release build.

Do note that Sonic's boost is broken in this. It was like that in the OG build from what I remember. If you want to fix it, go ahead, since I doubt I'll learn how to do blueprints in the future.
